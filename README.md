# caesar-cipher
Caesar Cipher project for The Odin Project

A caesar cipher was used by some really old guy so that his parents couldn't read his fanfictions, probably.
It works by moving every character a specified amount down the alphabet so that others cannot read it.
It is a very simple form of encryption, often used in other more sophisticated forms of encryption.

The ruby file asks for a sentence from the user and the amount to shift the values by, then outputs the
encrypted sentence.
